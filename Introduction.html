                Here is a breif description of my background and accomplishments:</h2>

        <div class="full-introduction"> 
            <p> 
                Throughout my life, I have been passionate about technology and how to best create technology to be transformative for users. 
                My interests in technology led my to study Information Analysis at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. 
                In the School of Information, or SI for short, I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Information degree and am expected 
                to graduate in May of 2023.  As a part of the Bachelor of Science in Information degree, I am studying Information Analysis, which is a 
                unique blend of strong technical, people, and communication skills. In addition to my major in Information Analysis, I am also pursuing a minor in applied statistics. 
            </p>

            <p>
                From my educational background, you may already expect that I am an extremely analytical thinker. 
                Thinking critically and stategic decisions excites me. I have been able to cultivate these skills recently in my rolls as a 
                research intern at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research and as a Consultant in Reach Consulting Group. 
                In both of these positions, I have been challenged to think on my feet and be confident in my decisions. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                In my past positions and as a student at Michigan, I have developed many technical skills, namely I am skilled in 
                Python Programming, HTML, CSS, R/R Studio, Tableau, and am in the process of learning many other technical skills. 
                I have also been able to cultivate skills in communication, presentation, and professionalism. 
                I know myself to be a creative, strategic thinker, who is very coachable and enjoys learning about new things.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I am specifically interested in the intersection of people, information, and technology and am
                passionate about creating products and experiences that are transformative for users. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Plans for the future:</h2>
            <p id="future"> 
                I am looking forward to completing my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan and then moving back to 
                New York to be closer to family and friends. I hope you enjoyed this brief description,
                and more information is available on my <a href="experience.html">experience</a> page.
